1. Create a game menu option called Snake and Ladder Game Problem 
• Consider a standard Snake and Ladder board of size  N×N with cells numbered from 1 to N2 
• You start from cell 1 and must reach cell  N2 
• Each move is decided by rolling a six-faced dice (values 1–6). 
• If you land at the base of a ladder, you must climb to its top. 
• If you land on the mouth of a snake, you must go down to its tail. 
• User Input: size of the board N (value between 6 and 12 ) 
• Set the number of ladders in the board as N-2

• Set the ladders & snakes starting & ending location randomly for each game round.

last cell by giving 3 choices

3. Create a game menu option called Traveling Salesman Problem 
• The distance between cities is randomly assigned to range from 50 to 100 kilometers in each game 
round. (See Figure 1) 
• Choose a random city to serve as the home city for each game round. 
• In each game round, allow the user to choose the cities they need to visit using the User Interface 
(Cities from A to J). 
• In each game round ask game player to find the shortest route from the home city to the user-selected 
cities exactly once and then return to the home city.  
• Find the shortest route for the  salesman problem using three different algorithm approaches. 
• Additionally, record the time taken for each algorithm in each game round in the database. 
• Save a game player's name, home city , randomly selected cities & shortest route in the database when 
they correctly identify an answer.

4. Create a game menu option called Tower of Hanoi 
• In each game round randomly select the number of disks (N) from 5 to 10. 
• In each game round ask user to select number of Pegs from 3 to 4. 
• Users are given N disks stacked in decreasing size on a Source (A) peg, and the objective is to move 
all disks to a Destination (D) peg using an auxiliary peg/s while following these rules: 
o Only one disk can be moved at a time. 
o A larger disk cannot be placed on a smaller disk. 
o user can use the auxiliary peg/s to help move the disks. 
• In each game round Ask user to enter the "number of moves" & "sequence of moves” to move a tower 
of that size from one peg to another. 
• When a game player correctly identifies an answer, save that person's name along with the correct 
response in the database. 
• Implement 2 algorithm approaches to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 Pegs.

• Include the Code used for unit Testing 
• In addition, record in the database how long each algorithm takes for every game round.

solution.  
• Apply appropriate validations & Exception Handling

other

in the Database. & Record the Time taken for it in the Database

• If another game player provides the same right response, indicate that the solution has already been 
recognized. Ask them to try again until the maximum number of solutions has been achieved.  
• When all the solutions have been identified by game players, the system should clear the flag that 
indicates solution has already been recognized. so that future game players can give same answers.
